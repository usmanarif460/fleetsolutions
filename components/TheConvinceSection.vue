            We build people professional websites <u>for free</u> that other
            agencies charge thousands of dollars for.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The reason we do this is simple: it’s a great way for us to build
            connections with business owners who might hire us for larger paid
            projects as their companies grow.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            More than 95% of the people we’ve built websites for have been happy
            with the results, and about 18% go on to hire us for additional paid
            projects or recommend friends who do.
